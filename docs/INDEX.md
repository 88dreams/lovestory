## Document Maintenance

### Update Frequency
- `README.md`: Update for major changes
- `TECHNICAL_SPECS.md`: Update as architecture evolves
- `DEVELOPMENT.md`: Update for environment changes
- `PROGRESS.md`: Update weekly/per sprint
- `API_ARCHITECTURE.md`: Update for API changes
- `TESTING.md`: Update as testing infrastructure evolves

### Best Practices
1. Keep documentation up to date
2. Use clear, concise language
3. Include code examples where relevant
4. Maintain consistent formatting
5. Add dates to major updates
6. Cross-reference between documents
7. Validate links and paths
8. Track implementation status with emojis (âœ…, ðŸš§, ðŸ“…)

## Getting Started
1. Start with `README.md` for project overview
2. Review `DEVELOPMENT.md` for setup
3. Check `TECHNICAL_SPECS.md` for implementation details
4. Review `API_ARCHITECTURE.md` for API integration
5. Follow `TESTING.md` for testing guidelines
6. Track progress in `PROGRESS.md`
